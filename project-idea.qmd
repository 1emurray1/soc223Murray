Final Project Idea: 

Creating a predictive model that can say with x% of confidence whether or not a CURRENT MLB player will make the Hall of Fame compared to previous inductees and their statistics. 

Lina: Thinking about engaging with 2023 women's world cup data vs Men's world cup. Goals scored. 
Ayanna: Comparing the NY Knicks to other NBA teams.. Whether or not the Knicks actually suck.
